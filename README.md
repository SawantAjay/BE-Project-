# Cattle-Health-Monitoring-System-with-Smart-Shelter

This project involved designing a sensor-equipped belt for cattle to monitor and track health parameters such as body temperature, heart rate, and movement. The collected data is transmitted to a master board within a smart shelter, which uses LoRa and IoT technology to send real-time information to a cloud server. The system enables remote monitoring of cattle health, helping farmers and veterinarians detect early signs of illness and ensure timely care, ultimately improving cattle welfare and farm management efficiency.
